# Line-encoding-and-decoding-simulator
Line encoding and decoding is a technique used in digital communication systems to convert binary data into a physical signal for transmission over a medium. This signal representation ensures proper synchronization, error detection, and efficient use of bandwidth. To implement a console-based simulator using the C programming language.

To demonstrate the process of encoding and decoding binary data using various line coding techniques.

To help visualize how each encoding scheme transforms binary data into signal levels.

To enhance understanding of signal behavior in digital communication systems.

To provide a user-friendly interface for selecting encoding schemes and observing output in real-time.

The Line Encoding Decoding Simulator was developed using the C programming language and additionally used MATLAB for visualization. The project was implemented in a console-based environment, making it compatible with popular development tools such as Code::Blocks, Dev-C++ or GCC on both Windows and Linux platforms. Standard C libraries like stdio.h, string.h, and stdlib.h were utilized to manage input/output operations, string manipulation and basic functions.
